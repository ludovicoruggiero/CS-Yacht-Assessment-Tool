## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).

## EcoDesign Guidelines

The `EcoDesign` section is available from the sidebar and lets users browse sustainability guidelines.
Normal users can filter guidelines by life-cycle phase and target group.
Administrators can add new guidelines and manage lookup tables (target groups and implementation groups).
The Supabase database schema for this feature is stored in `sql/ecodesign_schema.sql`.
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
